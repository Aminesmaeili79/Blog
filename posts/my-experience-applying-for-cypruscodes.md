# How did I find CyprusCodes and applied for the fullstack developer Application

First and foremost, I have to say that I am pretty much happy working with the CyprusCodes and Futurecast.io teams, as the team and the members are very professional and sophisticated, and the environment is very up-beat and helping for new members like me.

One day I was going through Linkedin open jobs and was applying to tens of positions from Node.js backend developer roles to fullstack MERN ones. Then I came across a mutual contact which was the Co-founder of CyprusCodes, and I decided to step up and ask him if there are any open positions at their company. He made an interview and assigned a task to evaluate my skills.

# About the task given to me

The task was simple: given a document of NASA API URLs, I had to create a responsive mobile-first web application where the user can filter out the content they would like to see based on the types (audio, video and image) and text input for a specific article or research that NASA has included in their API. There is the link to the project that I implemented: [NASA Project](https://aminesmaeili79.github.io/NASA-Project)

I came up with a fancy loading animation to attract the audience and hook them up a little bit to the website. Then there is another animation for the hero section of the website to show the team and astronauts of NASA. The design is simple, yet beautiful and minimalist. The user can read the docs of the API used in the application, the source code, and of course the main search page.

The trickiest part was to implement the pagination, but thanks to the API, I used the 'count' property to go through iterations of 24 articles for each page and render the corresponding articles and research papers. I didn't stop here and went further and added other features like caching, adding subtitles to the videos, and form validation.

# What happened afterwards?

After the team reviewed my task, they decided to make another technical interview on how I implemented the mentioned project and more technical questions about React and web development. A few days later, they contacted me and I got the happy new! I became a part of the Blinx project that CyprusCodes and Futurecast.io are currently working on and have been working as a part of the team for almost 10 days.

# What has been going on so far?

There hasn't been going on much yet, but refactoring one of the main projects of ours, but the team is very kind and knowledgable. I really appreciate the effort I put into this to get to know these people and my team and am pretty optimistic about the future of myself with them.

I know this blog seems a bit short, but I will post more updates after the first month, 3 months and a year and will tell you more about what I learn and do as a part of the team. Hope anyone who is reading this the best of best, and do not quit on your dreams. Go hard on yourself and you'll find what you have been going after.

Your computer lover, Amin.
